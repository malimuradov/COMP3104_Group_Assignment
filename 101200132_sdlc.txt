It is important to give structure to the phases involved in software development efforts and SDLC serves that purpose. The SDLC does not conclude until all the phases have been successfully fulfilled. All the potential needs have to be adjusted within the system. The most visible advantage of the SDLC life cycle is that it provides control of the development process to some extent and ensures that the software system complies with all the estimated requirements. The software development life cycle (SDLC) does not work well where there is uncertainty to some extent. There are no chances of adding creative inputs and the entire process follows from the planning phase. For all these reasons and more, organizations these days are inclined towards adopting the Agile Software Development Approach as it is incremental rather than being sequential.
