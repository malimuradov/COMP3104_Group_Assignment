DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two
major related trends. The first was also called “agile
infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it sprang from
applying Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.

DevOps is a combination of software development and
information technology operations that enables
businesses to deliver applications at a faster pace. It
brings together development and operations teams so
there are fewer redundancies in the software
development process.
