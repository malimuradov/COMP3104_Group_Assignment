DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two
major related trends. The first was also called “agile
infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it sprang from
applying Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.


DevOps is a combination of software development and
information technology operations that enables
businesses to deliver applications at a faster pace. It
brings together development and operations teams so
there are fewer redundancies in the software
development process.

DevOps culture brings the cohesion of
autonomous teams to fast paced,
high-demanding environments.
It has a set of processes that when
applied correctly can:
• Drastically reduce IT overhead
• Remove manual tasks both of a
mundane or complex nature
• Enforce best security practices
• Expedite product delivery
• Improve communication and
collaboration across teams
