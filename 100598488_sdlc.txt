Tools used-
Git is a distributed version control tool that supports distributed non-linear workflows by providing data assurance for developing quality software. Tools like Git enable communication between the development and the operations team.
When you are developing a large project with a huge number of collaborators, it is very important to have communication between the collaborators while making changes in the project.
Commit messages in Git play a very important role in communicating among the team. Apart from communication, the most important reason to use Git is that you always have a stable version of the code with you.
Hence, Git plays a vital role in succeeding at DevOps.
